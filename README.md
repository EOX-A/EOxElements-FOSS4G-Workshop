### EOxElements: Your Building Blocks for Geospatial UI Development

### Workshop Duration: 2 hours

### Objective:
The goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to EOxElements and provide hands-on experience in using it to create web-based geospatial applications, specifically focusing on accessing and working with STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) catalogs. Additionally, the workshop will introduce eodash, an open-source library that simplifies working with STAC catalogs.

### Pre-requisites:
- Participants should bring their own laptops.
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with geospatial concepts (optional but beneficial).

### Workshop Outline:

#### **0. Introduction and Setup (15 minutes)**
1. **Welcome and Overview (5 minutes)**
   - Introduction to EOxElements.
   - Overview of what will be covered in the workshop.
   - Brief introduction to STAC and its relevance in geospatial data management.

2. **Setup (10 minutes)**
   - Guide participants to install necessary tools and libraries.
     - Ensure everyone has a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
     - Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed).
     - Clone the EOxElements repository or download the necessary files.
     - Basic setup of a local web server (e.g., using `http-server` or similar tool).

#### **I. Understanding EOxElements (20 minutes)**
1. **Introduction to EOxElements Components (10 minutes)**
   - Overview of the key components provided by EOxElements (e.g., map viewer, layer manager, UI elements).
   - Explanation of the functionalities of each component and how they interact.
   - Examples of use cases where these components can be effectively utilized.

2. **Introduction to Custom Elements (Web Components) and Their Benefits (5 minutes)**
   - Briefly explain the concept of custom elements (web components) and their role in modern web development.
   - Discuss the benefits of using web components, such as encapsulation, reusability, and interoperability.
   - Highlight how EOxElements leverages custom elements to provide a modular and maintainable codebase.

3. **Exploring Documentation and Examples (5 minutes)**
   - Show participants where to find the official documentation and examples.
   - Walk through a basic example to demonstrate how EOxElements works.

#### **II. Hands-On Session: Building a Simple Map Application (45 minutes)**
1. **Creating a Basic Map (15 minutes)**
   - Guide participants through creating a simple HTML file.
   - Include necessary EOxElements scripts and styles.
   - Initialize a basic map using EOxElements components.

2. **Adding Layers (15 minutes)**
   - Demonstrate how to add different types of layers (e.g., base layers, overlay layers).
   - Show how to configure layer properties (e.g., visibility, opacity).

3. **Interactivity and Controls (15 minutes)**
   - Introduce interactive elements such as zoom controls, layer switcher, and pop-ups.
   - Show how to add these controls to the map and customize their appearance and behavior.

#### **III. Working with STAC Catalogs and eodash (30 minutes)**
1. **Introduction to STAC (5 minutes)**
   - Explain what a STAC catalog is and its importance in geospatial data.
   - Brief overview of STAC API endpoints.

2. **Accessing and Displaying STAC Data (15 minutes)**
   - Demonstrate how to use EOxElements to access a STAC catalog manually.
   - Show how to fetch and parse STAC metadata using JavaScript.
   - Guide participants through the process of displaying STAC assets (e.g., satellite images) on the map using EOxElements.

3. **Introduction to eodash (10 minutes)**
   - Overview of eodash and its functionalities.
   - Demonstrate how eodash simplifies the process of accessing and displaying STAC data.
   - Show examples of using eodash out-of-the-box features for geospatial applications.

#### **IV. Q&A and Wrap-Up (15 minutes)**
1. **Q&A Session (10 minutes)**
   - Open the floor for participants to ask questions about EOxElements, STAC catalogs, eodash, troubleshooting, and best practices.
   - Provide solutions to common issues that may have arisen during the hands-on session.

2. **Wrap-Up and Next Steps (5 minutes)**
   - Summarize the key takeaways from the workshop.
   - Provide additional resources for learning more about EOxElements, STAC, eodash, and geospatial web development.
   - Encourage participants to continue experimenting and building with EOxElements and eodash.

### Materials Provided:
- Workshop slides with step-by-step instructions.
- Sample code files for each section.
- Links to documentation, examples, and additional resources.

### Follow-Up:
- Email participants a feedback form to gather insights on the workshop.
- Provide a link to a GitHub repository or online forum where participants can share their projects and ask further questions.

This structure ensures that participants not only learn about the capabilities of EOxElements but also gain practical experience in accessing and working with STAC catalogs and leveraging eodash to build their own geospatial applications efficiently.
