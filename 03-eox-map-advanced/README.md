# 03: Advanced usage of `eox-map`

This section continues with the map element, diving deeper in advanced layers and sources, configuring the view, and adding controls.

## Import package

In order to use advanced layers and sources in our `eox-map` (all OL `layer` and `source` types, plus some additional custom ones - see [documentation](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/elements-eox-map--docs), we need more than just the base bundle.
Additionally to importing `@eox/map`, now also import the `@eox/map/dist/eox-map-advanced-layers-and-sources.js` package into [main.js](./main.js):

```js
import "https://unpkg.com/@eox/map/dist/eox-map-advanced-layers-and-sources.js";
```

## Setting the layers

Let's add two more layers to our `eox-map`:

### Tile layer with WMTS source from capabilities

This custom source fetches a capabilities xml and automatically renders the defined layer:

```js
{
  type: "Tile",
  properties: {
    id: "s2cloudless"
  },
  source: {
    type: "WMTSCapabilities",
    url: "https://tiles.maps.eox.at/wmts/1.0.0/WMTSCapabilities.xml",
    layer: "s2cloudless-2020_3857",
  },
},
```

### Layer from STAC

This custom layer creates a layer (group) from e.g. a STAC collection. Powered by the Open Source library [ol-stac](https://github.com/m-mohr/ol-stac).

```js
{
  type: "STAC",
  properties: {
    id: "stacLayer",
  },
  url: "https://tamn.snapplanet.io/search?bbox=125.727770,-29.514858,133.412707,-23.673395&collections=S2&datetime=2024-06-18T00:00:00Z",
  displayPreview: true,
},
```

### Setting zoom and center

Try setting the `zoom` and `center` properties to focus the map on Australia:

```js
document.querySelector("eox-map").zoom = 4;

document.querySelector("eox-map").center = [125, -30];
```

Note: in real-world usecases, you'd probably not want to set these properties separately, but rather use the `config` object (see [example](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/story/elements-eox-map--config-object)) or via e.g. the `zoomExtent`:

```js
document.querySelector("eox-map").config = {
  layers: [...],
  view: {
    zoomExtent: ...
  }
}

```

### Adding controls

To add some map controls, add the `controls` object inside `config`:

```js
controls: {
  Zoom: {},
},
```

It supports all the controls as described in the [OpenLayers docs](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_control_Control-Control.html). Initializing a control with an empty object adds it with default values, but you can pass more properties inside to customize it. Try adding an `OverviewMap` control and set its `layers` property (using the same syntax as for the "main" map)!

## Result

Your page should look something like this (if you zoom to Australia):
